Calculus work and engineering functions to fit mathematical models


## Definitions
DERIVATIVE:
the sum and difference rules (f+-g)' = f'+-g' we differentiate each term.
the power rule, where derivative of any x^n is  nx^n-1, we apply this to 
the derivative of any cx is c, we apply this to 
the derivative of a constant is zero we can apply this to our constant, 
We find the derivative first below:

## Equations
DERIVATIVE EQUATIONS:
the product rule: (u*v)'= u'v+uv'
the quotient rule: (f/g)'= gf'=fg'/g^2
the chain rule: f(g(x))'= f'(g(x))g'(x)

POINT SLOPE EQUATIONS:
the equation for a line y= mx+b
the equation for a point on a line y1-y2= m(x1-x2)

ANTIDERIVATIVE
antiderivative of x^n(dx)= (1/(n+1))(x)^n+1+C

MEAN VALUE THEOREM:
f'c = f(b)-f(a)/b-a

LINEAR APPROXIMATION
L(x)= f(a)-f’(a)(x-a) and is accurate for values close to x=a

ERROR IN APPROXIMATION
Delta Y = f(x+delta X)- f(x)  (delta y is called propagated error) ACTUAL change in y
Dy= f’(x)dx  differential of y represents the change in y    ESIMATE change in y
Dx or Delta X is the measurement error. 

SKETCHING:
FIRST DERIVATIVE
We use the first derivative of  f(x)  to find the critical points and intervals of increase and decrease. 
CRITICAL POINTS
Find cp by setting the derivative to 0.  To find exact points, plug into original equation
INTERVALS
find intervals of increase/decrease by selecting intervals and plugging into derivative to find the sign + or -.
SECOND DERIVATIVE
We use the second derivative of  f(x)  to find the points of inflection and intervals concavity 
IINFLECTION POINTS
Find inflection points by setting the second derivative to 0. Plug into original equation  to find exact points of inflection.
CONCAVITY
find concavity intervals by selecting arbitrary intervals and plugging into second derivative to find the sign + or 
Horizonal assymptotes
if degree numerator = denominator HA = degree 
if degree numerator < denominator HA = 0
if degree numerator > denominator no HA
Vertical assymptotes
set denominator = 0, if no denominator, no HA
